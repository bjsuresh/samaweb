                    aggregate functions. The dashboards freely user configurable and there can be as many dashboards as

                    The dashboard visualizes data using different types of elements (dashboard items) - charts, scatter charts,
                    grids and pivot tables, maps, Treemaps, pies, cards, gauges etc. - and allows users to interact with these
                    elements. End-users can filter a dashboard using the Master Filtering feature, perform a drill-down to
                    change the detail level of data, or use dynamic parameters.

                    <li>Calculated Fields that allow you to apply complex expressions to data fields obtained from the data

                    <li>Parameters are dynamic values that can replace constants in expressions, calculated fields, etc. You
                        can also use dashboard parameters to filter a SQL data source dynamically. Example From
